      There has been an addition of buildings in our school. It has added a few new buildings such as the 'Gallagher Rooms' which is one of the school houses
      and in those rooms, learning can be more flexible and fun as they have a lot of space in the inside and in those classes that will be held their
      will be the classes of those who are advanced in certain subjects. That means less people, more space, easier relaxation and less stress.
      The room is just outside of the canteen, so at lunchtime, you can get your lunch much quicker, as everyone is hungry but sometimes have to wait
      in line.
